    "summary" : "Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art student's assignment, but Luis brings depth, shadows, light, form and color to new heights with his unique and revolutionary technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze.",
    "description": "<p>Luis was born in Puerto Rico, but grew up in Central Florida after his family moved to Orlando when he was a year old. His father worked at an autobody shop and brought home scrap materials for Luis to create his early mixed media art. From that point on, Luis became hooked on creating art from scrap metals, fabrics, wood, canvas, and many others. During his junior year at Full Sail in Orlando, he perfected his own proprietary method of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze, which he will demonstrate on Monday in his session, 'Art in Full Bloom'.</p><p>Luis paints with an extraordinary amount of color, and prefers to create art centered around nature, animals, and science. Now in his senior year at Full Sail, Luis has been creating mixed media totem poles made from old telephone poles, and other recycled materials, and is already planning his next new technique that will likely inspire a trend for years to come.</p>",

    "description": "<p>Leslie is a sophomore art sculpture student at Rollins College, and has already won major prizes for new painters, including the International Painter's Meda. Leslie's OMA exhibit features paintings that contain only water images including waves, deep sea, and river.</p><p>An avid water sports participant, her goal in creating the OMA exhibit was to share this interest with others. In addition to the display, Leslie also hosts a session on Tuesday called Deep Sea Wonders, which combines her love of deep sea diving, with instruction for capturing the beauty of underwater explorations on canvas.</p>",

    "summary": "The leader of the MMA artistic movement in his hometown of Portland, Gene Creamer draws a crowd wherever he goes. Mixing street performance, video, music, and traditional art, Gene has created some of the most unique works of his generation.",
    "description": "<p>Gene started out as musician and street performance artist, and now blends painting and photography with audio, video, and computer multimedia to create what he calls 'Music and Multimedia Artworks.' Gene's innovations in using multimedia to express art have created a youth culture movement in his town of Portland. In his role as the founder of the MMA art form, Gene has become an inspiration to many up and coming artists. However, the part Gene insists is most important to him, is that he's helped many troubled youth take control of their lives, and create their own unique, positive futures. Seeing kids he's mentored graduate from high school and enroll in college, gives art the purpose that Gene so craves.</p><p>A first-year student at the Orlando Art Academy, Gene is already changing the face of modern art at the university. Gene's exquisite abstract pieces have no intention of ever being understood, but instead beg the viewer to dream, create, pretend, and envision with their mind's eye. Gene will be speaking on the 'Art of Abstract' during Thursday's schedule.</p>",
